    "## Introduction\n",
    "This code defines a protocol for picking colonies from defined locations on a colony plate to a target plate for a downstream colony PCR protocol. The protocol has been split into two as the image and colony locations will have to be retreived on a seperate platform. Therefore, protocol1 must be run first so the camera can be in the correct position to take an image then once the locations are retrieved, this can be entered into the protocol2 and run to pick the colony.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol 1\n",
    "The first protocol moves the robot, and hence the camera, by a calibrated offset from 'A1' of the labware below to a defined location above the colony plate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Protocol 2\n",
    "The second protocol takes the colony locations then moves the robot to pick the colonies and perform the rest of the colony PCR steps. The location of the colonies is defined as an offset relative to the top left corner of the light table. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code has been divided into sections with the functions move_camera and pick_colony for modularity thereby allowing it to be integrated into other protocols."
